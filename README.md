# hello-world

I'm really enjoying learning about programming so far. I never knew I would learn so much in the first two weeks, such as all the basics of **Git** and **Github** as well as **flowcharts** and **pseudocode**. In my Python class, I learned a few new things even though I already know Python and can solve simple problems with it. For example, I had never heard of **f-strings** before. I look forward to becoming a professional software developer in the next two years!

Now I want to learn how a =task list= works:
- [x] Follow a tutorial.
- [x] Create a task list.
- [ ] Save the file and see what the task list looks like.

All right, now I'm just being silly. H~2~O
